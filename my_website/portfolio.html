The way the game worked was when the fruit was<br> touching the wizard, then the fruit would switch costume and then disappear and reappear.</p>

        <p class = "h3" id = "paragraph2">The purpose of this game was to beat your previous record of the game and keep setting new records.<br> This game was a combination of "Temple Run" and "Flappy Bird" where in our game the user used<br> the arrow keys to dodge the moving objects that were heading toward them. Some of the problems that<br> I faced when I was creating the game was when the flying/moving objects were coming out. I fixed this<br> problem by broadcasting a call when one of the objects were done in order for the next one to run. With<br> this kind of program was able to make the game continous and create the game harder as the user<br> progresses throughout the game, by using or calling different broadcasts.</p>
