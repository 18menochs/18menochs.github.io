    <p class = "firstgame">First Game</p>
    <p class = "h3">The purpose of this game was to cut fruit that was placed around the screen, and 
    once the<br>user cut one fruit, another one would appear. The way the game worked was when the fruit
    was<br>touching the wizard, then the fruit would switch costume and then disappear and reappear.</p>

    <p class = "firstgame">My Game</p>
    <p class = "h3">The purpose of this game was to beat your previous record of the game and keep setting
    new records.<br> This game was a combination of "Temple Run" and "Flappy Bird" where in our game the user 
    used<br> the arrow keys to dodge the moving objects that were heading toward them. Some of the problems that<br>
    I faced when I was creating the game was when the flying/moving objects were coming out. I fixed this<br> problem 
    by broadcasting a call when one of the objects were done in order for the next one to run. With<br> this kind of 
    program was able to make the game continous and create the game harder as the user<br> progresses throughout the game, 
    by using or calling different broadcasts.</p>

    <p class = "firstgame">Python Interactive Story</p>
    <p class = "h3">In the story you are playing as Alexander who is offered a quest in which he has to kill a mage. In order
    to complete his quest, Alexander travels across the land of Riverdell to soon find out that the mage is within a castle.</p>
    <a href="https://repl.it/FC3Q/1" id="interactivelink">Play Alexander's Quest</a>
    <p class = "h3">To produce this story, the entire code of this story is mainly based on if-else statements. Some of the problems
    that were met during the creation of the story was figuring out how to go back into the storyline in order to remake a decision. 
    Some of the parts of the story that I really liked were the many choices the user gets to make throughout the story as well as the 
    choice of going back in the story to make different decisions. Some of the other stories I read, were being stranded on an island 
    and deciding what to do in order to survive. One thing that I would improve on if I were able to do this all over again would be able
    to have some of the decisions that were made to be saved so previous decisions would affect future events.</p>
